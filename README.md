# Scene Graph Generation Repository

Welcome to the Scene Graph Generation Repository! This repository contains code and resources for generating scene graphs using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).

## Overview

Scene graphs are a powerful representation of relationships between objects in an image. This project aims to generate scene graphs from images using a GNN-based approach. The repository is organized as follows:

- `data/`: Directory for storing datasets and data-related files.
- `models/`: Contains GNN model architecture and related code.
- `utils/`: Utilities for data processing, visualization, and more.
- `experiments/`: Store different experiments, each in its subdirectory.
- `train.py`: Script for training the scene graph generation model.
- `evaluate.py`: Script for evaluating the trained model's performance.
- `main.py`: Main script to execute training and evaluation pipelines.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
