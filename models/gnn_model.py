# Step 1: Data Preparation (Assuming you have data in NumPy arrays)
# X_scene_graph: Scene graph data (features)
# X_common_sense: Common sense knowledge data (features)
# y: Enhanced scene graph attributes (labels)

# Combine scene graph and common sense data
X_combined = np.concatenate((X_scene_graph, X_common_sense), axis=1)

# Split the data into training, validation, and test sets
X_train, X_temp, y_train, y_temp = train_test_split(X_combined, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)
X_val, X_test, y_val, y_test = train_test_split(X_temp, y_temp, test_size=0.5, random_state=42)

# Step 2: Feature Scaling (You may need more advanced preprocessing)
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_val_scaled = scaler.transform(X_val)
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)

# Step 3: Model Training (Random Forest Classifier as an example)
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)

# Step 4: Model Evaluation
y_pred = model.predict(X_test_scaled)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Accuracy on the test set: {accuracy:.4f}")
